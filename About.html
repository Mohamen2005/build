        <h3>About Roca</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>More than 100 years of history that have made us a worldwide reference</h4>
        <p>Roca began its activity in 1917, manufacturing cast iron radiators for domestic heating in its factory in
            Gavà (Barcelona). In addition to the first cast iron radiators, it complemented its catalogue with the
            production of boilers and in 1929 entered the bathroom sector with the manufacturing of baths.</p>
        <p>Always aware of the changes in society related to the water culture, the main natural resource the company
            works with, in 1936 Roca faced the challenge of producing vitreous china and in 1954 started the
            manufacturing of faucets.</p>
        <p>In the 1990s the Group carried out a first international expansion phase, mainly based on the opening of
            subsidiaries and the signing of agreements with leading companies in their markets. In addition to Portugal
            and France, the commercial presence started expanding to United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Argentina,
            Brazil and China.</p>
        <p>The turning point in the internationalisation process came in 1999 with the acquisition of the Swiss group
            Keramik Holding Laufen, the world's fourth largest manufacturer of vitreous china sanitary ware. The
            purchase of Laufen allowed the Group to consolidate its presence in strategic markets where it was less
            established, mainly in Eastern Europe, Brazil and the United States.</p>
        <p>In 2005 Roca announced an ambitious strategic plan focused on the bathroom space sector, and achieved world
            leadership in the sector in 2006.</p>
        <p>Today Roca's commercial network reaches more than 170 countries, supplied by its 81 production plants and its
            more than 21,000 employees all around the world.</p>
        <p>Nowadays Roca continues to be a 100% Spanish company engaged in the creation of bathroom spaces, an activity
            that has made it a global benchmark. Achieving this dimension is a source of great pride, almost as
            important as having been one of the best-known, most valued and most integrated brands in the imagination of
            Spanish society for decades.</p>
        <p>To take a step further in its commitment to society, the Roca Barcelona Gallery, a flagship building that
            provides a brand experience, opened in 2009, followed by the Galleries in Madrid, Lisbon, London, Shanghai
            and Beijing.</p>
        <p>Spaces to interact with Roca's water culture, its products and its values, which also host cultural
            activities, exhibitions, conferences and debates related to topics like design, sustainability or
            architecture. Events that are proof of Roca's interest in moving forward hand in hand with society for many
            more years.</p>
